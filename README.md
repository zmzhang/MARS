## MS-Assisted Resolution of Signal  ##

A MATLAB toolbox, called MS-Assisted Resolution of Signal (**MARS**), is proposed for extracting QUAL&QUAN information automatically from complex datasets with baseline, noise and retention time shift. **MARS** can be very useful for processing large-scale GC-MS dataset.
